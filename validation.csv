"Subject: re : pre - submitted question on espeak  erin ,  a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent  non - technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most  important  references to more advanced books and papers .  the book has an endorsement by jeff skilling on the cover page .  the research group offered several one - day seminars on real options  and applications to the energy industry . we still have a few binders with  the presentation materials available if you are interested .  we plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall .  the first part of the seminar ( about 4 hours in the morning ) covers general  concept of real options  and their applicability to the energy business .  the second , more technical afternoon session , covers stochastic processes used  to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case  studies ( valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas - fired  power plants ) .  the real options approach has been developed specifically to address the  problem of making  investment decisions under uncertainty . nobody in this field claims that this  is a  perfect tool , but it represents a significant progress compared to other  techniques developed  earlier .  discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through  analysis of several , in most cases , arbitrary scenarios ( most likely ,  optimistic ,  pessimistic ) . these scenarios don ' t identify explicitly the risk drivers  and don ' t specify the future proactive management decisions .  the real , option approach is very powerful because it allows to ( 1 ) capture  uncertainty in an explicit way and ( 2 ) to design investment projects that  allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to  downside risk .  this approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and  future  operational decisions . forward - looking investment decisions create options  that are exercised  in the future through active management of a project .  the real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to  come  up with the representation of future possible states of the world . the real  challenge is  to use these tools in a sensible way . i have seen in my career ( almost 30  years  of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems ) many quants  armed with  powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers . the  challenge is not  to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions  but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand  specific businesses  into parsimonious quantitative models . it is especially critical to  stress - test the assumptions  of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends  critically on any set of assumptions .  if this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying  assumptions .  i remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the  dynamics of oil prices ,  but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very  optimistic upward trend .  one would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question  what economics 101  teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand .  enron north america corp .  from : erin rice @ enron 06 / 27 / 2000 03 : 52 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : pre - submitted question on espeak  good news ! there is already a question waiting for your july 12 espeak  session . i have pasted it below , although you don ' t have to respond until  the actual event . don ' t forget to send a bulleted list of discussion topics  if you would still like us to advertise the event on the elevator screens .  thanks .  - er  submitted by breineck  i was doing some reading about the application of real options in the  evaluation of non - financial assets . would you recommend any texts or articles  for a  more in - depth study of this area ?

"Subject: a & a math majors  vince ,  thank you so much for meeting with me friday morning about the research  group .  after leaving your office , i remembered an issue i have had with the analyst  & associate program that might be of interest to you .  during a texas a & m recruiting meeting , i learned that we have expanded our  list of majors to include computer science . i wondered why math majors were  not mentioned , and was told that there was not a business need for math  majors . like liberal arts majors , they said math majors were only considered  on a person by person basis . in my opinion , math majors have many of the  same skills as finance majors , and can easily adjust to accounting rotations  as well ( i did last summer , and finance majors in the program are forced to  every year . ) i think that enron is missing out on many qualified candidates  by limiting their recruitment effort .  at texas a & m the career center asks companies for a list of majors they are  targeting , and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the  career center . i sent my resume to enron and asked to be included in the  interview process on campus . however , many other math majors had not heard  of enron or the other companies , and assumed that there was no place for a  math major at a company like enron . many math majors want to continue their  education , become teachers , or work for an actuarial firm . however , many  are undecided . we are constantly told of the many business possibilities  available to math majors by our teachers and staff , but many undergraduates  are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business  environment . by not mentioning math majors to the career center ( a very  simple and inexpensive step ) , enron is losing out on a very talented pool of  people . while it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about enron  already , had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math  majors would fit perfectly , and went the extra step to send enron their  resume outside the career center system , there are many qualified students  who do not do this , and opt for other companies who did mention math majors .  i called a manager in the a & a program to suggest that we consider at least  mentioning math majors to the career centers . i realize that it may cost  more to actively pursue them , talk to teachers , and attend math society  events . however , i told her that including them at the career center would  be very inexpensive for enron . she reiterated that they saw no business need  for math majors , and that if more upper level people began requesting them ,  it would be considered . i searched for "" mathematics "" on the enron job  website , and had a surprising number of results . i know that your group  could use math majors as well . however , this still may be too small a number  to merit a focus from the a & a recruiting department . i just wanted to bring  it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed .  thanks ,  heather johnson  x 53240",0,subject math majors vince thank much meeting friday morning

"Subject: lng by rail  vince ,  i was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to jeff shankman  about , in the dabhol lng context . it occurred to me that one way to collect  on regas charges , and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the  railways .  some time back , i had looked into the possiblility of transporting lng by  train . apparently , technology exists wherein lng can be put into cryogenic  containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded  from trucks to train bogies . i believe this maybe a way to earn some monies  with lng by developing just such a market in india for commercial customers .  it is pertinent to note that the konkan rail line is just about 1 hr . 45  minutes from the dabhol plant . trucks from dabhol could carry lng to the  rail line at guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of  india . if we target end - consumers directly , we could easily sell at retail  type prices , and build in a large margin , even if the volumes disposed are  relatively smaller . ( the alternative fuel for most of these establishments  is diesel or naphtha which is highly priced , and mostly trucked along  roads , increasing costs ) . the end aim is to keep income targets in india , so  that the analysts do not have a field day with the stock .  hence keeping activity up in india , and showing that solutions exist , will  keep stock price buoyed . we could explore this idea if it appeals !  regards ,  sandeep .",0,subject lng rail vince thinking type things could talking jeff shankman dabhol lng context occurred one way collect regas charges still find alternate cutomers gas railways time back looked possiblility transporting lng train apparently technology exists wherein lng put cryogenic containers trucked well containers loaded trucks train bogies believe maybe way earn monies lng developing market india commercial customers pertinent note konkan rail line hr minutes dabhol plant trucks dabhol could carry lng rail line guhagar could travel west coast india target end consumers directly could easily sell retail type prices build large margin even volumes disposed relatively smaller alternative fuel establishments diesel naphtha highly priced mostly trucked along roads increasing costs end aim keep income targets india analysts field day stock hence keeping activity india showing solutions exist keep stock price buoyed could explore idea appeals regards sandeep

"Subject: capital book  to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge .  the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below .  the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged .  capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity .  on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost .  by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization .  questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to :  joe deffner 853 - 7117  alan quaintance 345 - 7731",0,subject capital book process reaching stated objectives increasing enron america velocity capital associated return invested capital decided create capital book capital book profit target associated managed joe deffner purpose creating book ensure transactions within enron americas form capital requirement structured correctly allocated appropriate cost capital charge previous numbers used business plans beginning year remain transactions place hold assets therefore assets currently held within business area capital charge remain internal ownership assets maintained originating business unit subject internal ownership policy outlined cost capital associated transactions enron americas set joe process separate apart current rac process transactions continue unchanged capital investments balance sheet continue accrue capital charge previously established rate transactions structured credit receive pure market pass actually incurred cost capital opposed previous across board charge transactions structured balance sheet credit priced based upon financial impact enron america overall credit capacity transactions deploy capital trading books capital book take finance reserve transaction similar way credit group takes credit reserve finance reserve used specifically fund capital required transaction noted capital book budget essentially charge origination trading groups actual cost sending market based capital pricing signals internally enron america sources capital liquidity better optimized across organization questions regarding capital book addressed joe deffner alan quaintance

tom gros a few weeks ago that will  give you an idea of what this research is about .  thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research  group next week .  paulo  pricing substitute products on the internet  objective :  to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold  on  the internet .  motivation :  this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and  optimization  models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological  innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of  information  which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .  furthermore ,  companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can  have access to .  the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue  faced  by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .  vcrs  or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about .  the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the  methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of  other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services .  research strategy :  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these  components are choice models and optimization models .  choice models :  choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice  remains .  these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models .  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet .  optimization :  traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term  profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know  your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must  therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component  ( learning ) .",0,subject summer

"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity  another ground breaking news alert from rlyc .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come .  although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year .  an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments .  the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally .  just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company .  below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years .  rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force !  rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards .  but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem .  rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms .  rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards  earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations .  the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers .  this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues .  $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries  mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico  with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances .  the problems with traditional money transfer methods  with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use .  with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets .  what is the best way to send remittances ?  by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country .  the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler .  rlyc has already begun filling orders  in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months .  rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers  rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition .  rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings  some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! !  rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions  through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry .  rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty .  rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market  rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars .  health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa .  this could be an enormous new market for rlyc  it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees .  experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp .  e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member .  prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies .  relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team  the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs .  with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top - notch management team to bring it all together , rlyc seems to be headed for sunny skies .  this company will not remain below the radar screens of wall street ' s mover shakers or even the average investor for much longer . . . if you are on the lookout for companies that have what it takes to experience rapid growth , but are still trading at rock bottom prices , you should call your financial advisor today about relay capital corp .

"Subject: dhabol  jeff ,  we shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from sandeep with the  numbers you have  requested . what follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on  the power situation in india  published by the financial times .  the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting  millions of people .  one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due  to power  shortages . it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced  by the dhabol plant ( expensive as it may be ) . the power cut affected 230  million people .  the second article is enron specific .  vince  asia - pacific : power failure hits north india  financial times ; jan 3 , 2001  by angus donald  tens of millions of people were left without electricity  in northern india  yesterday after a power grid breakdown .  electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and  most parts of the  capital new delhi , with 60 to 70 per cent of supply  expected to be restored  by the end of the day , according to power grid  officials .  the associated chambers of commerce and industry  ( assocham ) , a  leading business organisation , expressed "" deep concern ""  and called for a  mechanism to prevent future disruption that could  "" cripple the economy "" .  the power failure across eight indian states , including  new delhi , disrupted  train services , water supplies and the telephone network  and forced  hospitals to switch to emergency generators .  the fault occurred on the northern grid , which provides  electricity for 226 m  people , and affected the states of delhi , haryana ,  punjab , uttar pradesh ,  himachal pradesh , madhya pradesh , rajasthan and jammu  and kashmir .  a breakdown at a sub - station in kanpur in uttar pradesh ,  india ' s most  populous state , caused an overload of power on other  lines , which then  failed as well .  trains stopped running for most of the day and signals  systems were  damaged . new delhi international airport was also  slightly affected before  its own power supply could be engaged .  "" we will probe into the reasons for the failure . it is  most likely to be a  technical failure , but we will investigate why it  happened , "" suresh prabhu ,  the power minister , was quoted as saying by press trust  of india .  india suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to  upgrade infrastructure . theft of supplies is also a big  problem . thirty per  cent of the country ' s electricity is stolen , according  to analysts . in new  delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen .  two years ago , a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh  and delhi for  hours .  assocham issued a statement , saying that increasing  industrial demand  would exacerbate the problems already faced by india ' s  inefficient power  sector . "" the slow progress , particularly in  strengthening the transmission  and distribution system , and ever increasing theft will  contribute to  worsening the power supply situation further . ""  copyright : the financial times limited  , copyright the financial times limited 2000 . "" ft "" and "" financial times ""  are trademarks of the financial times . privacy policy | terms jan 3 , 2001  by khozem merchant  enron , the us energy producer and a constant target of  criticism in india , is  hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a  profiteering  multinational .  its "" myth and reality "" offensive in local newspapers  follows the west indian  state of maharashtra ' s decision to review the tariff it  pays the texas - based  company , whose dollars 2 . 2 bn electricity generating  plant at dabhol is  india ' s biggest single foreign investment .  maharashtra ' s tariff has more than doubled since 1993  and is three times  greater than that charged by other independent power  producers ( ipps ) .  the tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the  rupee against the  dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha  fuel . the state also pays  a fixed capacity charge of rs 970 m ( dollars 21 m ) a month ,  reflecting the  huge project cost and , controversially , irrespective of  consumption .  a showdown looks inevitable , reminiscent of a clash six  years ago that  damaged india ' s appeal to foreign investors . a former  official of the world  bank , which has criticised the deal , says enron is  emerging "" as the east  india company of the 21 st century "" - a reference to the  british trader that  colonised key areas of the indian economy in the 19 th  century .  the stand - off is the latest blot on india ' s power  sector . the uk ' s powergen  and cogentrix of the us have quit india recently ,  frustrated by long approval  procedures , inadequate payments mechanisms or because of  higher  returns elsewhere .  "" india has lost time and opportunity and has driven  returns down by six  percentage points , "" says gerry grove - white , former india  general manager  of powergen , which has sold its 655 mw plant in gujarat  to china light &  power of hong kong .  india ' s national plan for the five years to 2002 says  generating capacity  must rise by 40 , 000 mw to about 120 , 000 mw . but since  1992 , ipps have  added only 3 , 000 mw and 2 , 500 mw remains under  construction . this is  insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8  per cent economic  growth .  enron was a bellwether of india ' s liberalisation ,  winning fast - track project  approval in the early 1990 s . phase 1 , a 740 mw plant  fuelled by expensive  naphtha came on stream in may 1999 , and phase 2 , a  dollars 1 . 87 bn plant  of 1 , 624 mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas ( lng ) ,  will be completed this year . only two of seven other  fast - track proposals  have achieved financial closure .  from the outset enron encountered attacks , culminating  in maharashtra ' s  then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating  terms no less onerous . vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister  of the successor  government , says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable .  enron , whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists , wants to maintain  good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment . enron views  india as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of  power plants to a broad - based trader of commodities ,  such as energy , gas  and bandwidth .  to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy  between power  surplus and deficit states , once legislation is passed  this year . it is building  an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas . and it is  laying a 15 , 000 km fibre - optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country  desperately short of this new economy commodity .  in any event , enron believes it has a watertight  contract . it is supported by  many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor  perception of maharashtra , india ' s financial and  industrial hub , as an  unreliable destination for investment .  mr deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his  predecessor , which  threatened to "" dump dabhol into the arabian sea "" - is  under pressure from  radical members of his wobbly coalition . but his options  are limited .  scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state  that would have to compensate shareholders .  maharashtra state electricity board , the local utility  and enron ' s main  client , is obliged to dispatch or "" off - take "" 90 per cent  of dabhol ' s output . yet  mseb has never honoured these guarantees . its off - take  has averaged 60  per cent since the plant opened and , in effect , mseb has  been paying a lot  more while consuming a lot less power .  one reason off - take is low is because the state ' s tough  new regulator has  told mseb to buy from cheaper sources . enron says the  tariff would be  rs 4 . 02 / kwh if mseb ' s off - take averaged 90 per cent . but  with off - take a  third lower , the average tariff is rs 4 . 94 per unit , and  often higher . in  october , the tariff was rs 6 . 91 per unit , when off - take  was about 49 per  cent . enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 ,  run on cheaper  lng , starts .  these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only  half of a 30 per  cent equity option in phase 2 . enron has acquired the  balance and  mandated bankers to find a buyer .  enron ' s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps ,  which have failed to  deliver the flood of investments . potential ipps feared  they would never be  paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt  management of power .  reform of state electricity boards , whose uneconomic  pricing means  industrial users subsidise poor farmers , as well as  transmission and  distribution ( t & d ) services to check huge theft and  technical losses , is  overdue . "" given the limited resources , money would be  better spent on t & d  rather than on new plant , "" says oliver blackaby ,  managing director of n m  rothschild in india , which is advising karnataka on the  privatisation of its  distribution network .  for the moment , attention is fixed on enron ' s ability to  satisfy the  competing interests of investors and clients . as sanjay  bhatnagar , chief  executive officer of enron india , said in a recent trade  magazine , one of the  key lessons learned from phase 2 is "" having flexibility  to deal with  externalities "" .  copyright : the financial times limited  , copyright the financial times limited 2000 .

"Subject: fyi : sycamore support on network planning  fyi :  note that the person mentioned in the text below ( ming lung lee ) is very  experienced in traditional traffic engineering work . he comes from mci where  he was responsible for modeling traffic etc . it appears that sycamore  finally got him . one time they had lost him to corvis ( another optical  equipment company ) , i guess sycamore went back to him with a better deal ! as  soon as this guy is available , i ' ll set up an all day technical meeting to  hash out what needs to be done as far as optimization algorithm development  is concerned . i want to produce a technical requirement document to clearly  outline what needs to be done to support dynamic , optical - switched - circuits  based trading and streaming media applications , etc . having such an industry  expert help us will help ' justify ' internally all the the effort on the  traffic analysis side that john griebling has asked us to support . keep in  mind that even though he is an expert in the field , the field that we need to  play in has not develop yet . even the emerging data based traffic ( as opposed  to voice where blocking of traffic is allowed ) analysis is an order of  magnitude more difficult ( due to uncertain load ) , let alone trading such load  ( which we are planning to do ! ) .  ravi .  . . . sycamore hired a guy per griebling ' s request , to work with you on the  design / planning piece of the business . he will be contracted out to enron  for a period of 6 months initially . he lives in sf but will be traveling to  whereever you need him . jim , griebling wanted us to set up a meeting  between you guys for wednesday morning , if you have time . his name is ming  lung lee and he comes to us from mci . let me know what works .  -

hence central intervention is needed .  in a grid of 13000 mw ( maharashtra grid size ) , absorbing an additional 1440  mw ( phase ii ) at one go is difficult ; however if we take western region , grid  size is 42000 mw . clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much  easier .  to this if we add northern and southern grids , we can probably evacuate out  another 500 - 700 mw through the interconnects . hence , there is definitely  value in looking at this issue at a national level .  additionally , it is not just solvable at that level , but actually answers to  the crying need for power in the country , and hence is a boon for the govt . ,  and should be treated as such .  consequences of not solving the problem  we can call upon the sovereign guarantee , which will cover our partial  payments . however , this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of  the country ' s credit rating - put back incoming investments into the  petroleum sector ( where private participation program is about to be unveiled  in 25 o we need to get someone to negotiate with . please use  your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes  central , state govt . , and seb representatives so that we can work on the  solution .  without active participation from pm ' s office , we are likely to waste  precious time bouncing between the seb , gom , and various ministries of goi .  hope this helps .  regards ,  sandeep .",0,subject points singh meet vince please find note prepared wade cline meeting representative prime minister office tomorrow think may find points useful additionally attaching copy small presentation made saturday mumbai roadblocks power sector special reference wat needs done start trading benefits working henwood team arrived today think good part data place arranging meeting officicals transmission side gather additional data krishan got last night conveyed best wishes hopefully useful day henwood folks tomorrow look forward houston possibly end coming week hope team well regards sandeep forwarded sandeep kohli enron development sandeep kohli wade cline enron development enron development cc subject points singh meet wade please find brief note feel tack n k singh supposed hard negotiator assuming introductory meeting sides feeling two meetings arranged weekend would hopefully given better idea thinking least two people issue incidentally indian system governor state central government nominee eyes ears central govt state please see basak meeting light message takes likely go directly pmo delhi therefore working closely convey right impression n k singh clearly three things would try convey description problem resultant consequences solved soon enough conveying fact win win solutions well within goi power implement would fact enhance reputation country one lives reputation would careful make point going give value willing accomodative mseb gom goi needs either financial engineering getting direct access market areas also fly well enron management comfortable market risks political describing problem dpc ppa backed goi mseb monthy collections improving range rs cr month mseb gom clearly resources short run yrs meet obligations hence central intervention needed grid mw maharashtra grid size absorbing additional mw phase ii one go difficult however take western region grid size mw clearly absorbing power framework much easier add northern southern grids probably evacuate another mw interconnects hence definitely value looking issue national level additionally solvable level actually answers crying need power country hence boon govt treated consequences solving problem call upon sovereign guarantee cover partial payments however would almost definitely lead deterioration country credit rating put back incoming investments petroleum sector private participation program unveiled need get someone negotiate please use good offices quickly form representative group includes central state govt seb representatives work solution without active participation pm office likely waste precious time bouncing seb gom various ministries goi hope helps regards sandeep

"Subject: re : storage model : simple issues  brad ,  here are my thoughts on your concerns .  * you needs curve inputs . this is an it job . i can help you for the curves  before the system is properly set up .  * intrinsic value vs time value :  the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes . if you have a  rough idea about the allocation as  you did in the spreadsheet , we can calucate the intrinsic value within the  model . the difference between the  total and the intrinsic will be the ( option ) time value . however , by  pre - allocating volumes , you killed some options .  in the storage model , volumes are allocated dynamically , therefore it is  hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs . time value .  * factor of loading : factor of loadings are used to give historical  correlation matrix . the three factors correspond to  paralle shift , slopping and curveture . the covariance matrix in the model  is expressed in the form  covar = row ( vol _ { i } ) * ( correl ( i , j ) ) * colum ( vol _ { j } ) where vols are  the implied volatilities from the vol curve .  ( correl ( i , j ) ) = l * l ' + residue ( small )  where l is the factor of loading matrix . so in a simple words , the factor of  loadings ( say , 60 x 3 ) are a simplier way for us to  remember the historical correlation matrix ( say , 60 x 60 ) .  let me know if i can offer further help .  zimin  brad horn 02 / 15 / 2000 07 : 15 am  to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect  cc : sandra henderson / hou / ect @ ect  subject : storage model : simple issues  zimin :  thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation . your right to  point out the similarity to market bids . here are some basic questions tied  to implementation and calibration :  model infrastructure / it support : i obviously need to re - build my link to the  forward curves as the model is not working in my new location . short - term  ( aprox 1 month ) , i ' d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod 32  in order to fetch the long - dated price and volatility curves . my link to ena  forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated  by the new bridgeline entity ( database name and data structure yet to be  defined ) . however , its not clear to me what is required in this two stage  process to support your model . any definition of model input or minimum  support requirements you provide is appreciated . i ' ll then work with sandra  henderson , an enron employee providing our it support , to ensure the model  continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take  place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases .  meanwhile , is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running  quickly ?  sandra : linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key  to all our pricing projects , not just the storage model supplied by research .  intrinsic vs extrinsic value : it would be helpful to decompose the model ' s  calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic ( time or  option ) value . i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model  inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value , and then through a simple  difference i could determine the extrinsic value . ive included a simple  spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review . i wanted to  share this with you to ask the following :  does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently  than the simple difference proposed ?  do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the  backcode c - code via . dll in order to ensure run - time is faster ?  my goal here is straightforward : a ) to better understand the model and its  sensitivities . ; and b ) to determine if and when the option approach is  associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of  the time spreads .  factor loadings : what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with  regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the 3  factors calculated ? factor loadings have always been a mystery to me . for  example , what problems should i be looking for as a warning against  mispricing ? what , if anything , is implied about 1 day price change or  expected curve re - shapings ( after all , curve - reshapings are key to storage  valuation ! ! ! ) ?  calibration : we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics  which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs . i ' ll share the  data when we are and model results once im up and running .",0,subject storage model simple issues brad thoughts concerns needs curve inputs job help curves system properly set intrinsic value vs time value intrinsic value depends allocate volumes rough idea allocation spreadsheet calucate intrinsic value within model difference total intrinsic option time value however pre allocating volumes killed options storage model volumes allocated dynamically therefore hard distinguish intrinsic vs time value factor loading factor loadings used give historical correlation matrix three factors correspond paralle shift slopping curveture covariance matrix model expressed form covar row vol correl j colum vol j vols implied volatilities vol curve correl j l l residue small l factor loading matrix simple words factor loadings say x simplier way us remember historical correlation matrix say x let know offer help zimin brad horn zimin lu hou ect ect cc sandra henderson hou ect ect subject storage model simple issues zimin thanks time revised storage valuation right point similarity market bids basic questions tied implementation calibration model infrastructure support obviously need build link forward curves model working new location short term aprox month like establish link ena database egsprod order fetch long dated price volatility curves link ena forward curves would quickly severed favor curves generated new bridgeline entity database name data structure yet defined however clear required two stage process support model definition model input minimum support requirements provide appreciated work sandra henderson enron employee providing support ensure model continues work regardless downstream system changes may take place build establish separate trading systems databases meanwhile anything think ensure im running quickly sandra linking excel spreadsheets bridgeline forward curves key pricing projects storage model supplied research intrinsic vs extrinsic value would helpful decompose model calculated storage price distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic time option value could easily link new spreadsheet tab model inputs calculate intrinsic value simple difference could determine extrinsic value ive included simple spreadsheet calculation intrinsic value review wanted share ask following nature model define intrinsic extrinsic value differently simple difference proposed think would make sense simple value decomposition backcode c code via dll order ensure run time faster goal straightforward better understand model sensitivities b determine option approach associating significant value beyond simple present value time spreads factor loadings thoughts insights offer regards factor loadings interpret graph factors calculated factor loadings always mystery example problems looking warning mispricing anything implied day price change expected curve shapings curve reshapings key storage valuation calibration preparing simple summary descriptive statistics allow refine model inputs share data model results im running

 steve :  i ' ll see if i can get in on the 25 th . . . will let you know , but i think  it ' ll work .  just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be  interested , abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying  behavior in the world ( 89 million us households , 3 billion + purchases ) ,  along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer  response to various offers at the household level . given the critical need  to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets , we believe  that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct  marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to  whatever the offer is - - improving the efficiency of mailings and other  promotional campaigns ( so there is an efficiency angle , see ! )  because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on  actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than  demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and "" new  entrants "" i ' ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have  some tests of our data underway , but we ' re interested in talking to as many  players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet  utility needs .  i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but  i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to  arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron  might have interest in hearing what we ' re up to , and ( most importantly )  listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets .  thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and  hearing how things are going for you .  regards ,  brad davids  303 - 410 - 5531  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com [ mailto : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com ]  sent : monday , april 10 , 2000 12 : 13 pm  to : brad . davids @ abacus - direct . com  subject : re : possible meeting ?

at - risk systems . in addition , vince has received the 1999 james h .  mcgraw award for energy risk management ( energy risk manager of the year )  and is well published . he is the key contributor to a best - selling  publication by risk books entitled : managing energy price risk .  our meeting was mainly focused on gaining additional insights re  leading - edge practices within ene . my key findings are summarized below :  1 . ene does not use corporate price premises . they use market price info  only and adhere to mark - to - market accounting .  2 . ene uses the "" heath , jarrow , and morton "" methods for modeling price  dynamics ( i ' ve asked bic for a copy of the associated paper ) . they have  their own "" home - grown "" software , however , they periodically review selected  external developments for internal inclusion and advancement .  3 . vince ' s group comprises of mathematicians , physicists , and operations  researchers who are responsible for the development and advancement of  ene ' s  risk management tools . these models are religiously used by the traders ,  risk managers , and bus across ene .  4 . investment proposals are screened , risked , and "" roved "" by a separate  corporate group ( similar to our special studies and with business and real  options skills ) who work in conjunction with the bus . all evaluations and  transactions are marked - to - market .  5 . ene does not use efficient - frontier portfolio concepts . they "" vc fund ""  any opportunity that has a credible value proposition and can stand on its  own . they believe that with the current plentiful liquidity in the market ,  project - financing in not an issue for a "" good "" opportunity . however , they  closely monitor the development of each opportunity , within their deep  portfolio , at the corporate level and know how to "" fail fast "" .  6 . the employee reward system is based on p & ls as well as the creation of  new business .  7 . most employees have stock options .  i really enjoyed my visit and hope to meet with vince again the next time  i ' m in houston .",0,subject houston visit thank much prompt reply pls let know going ny otherwise look forward seeing soon houston soussan original message vince j kaminski enron com mailto vince j kaminski enron com sent tuesday april faizs texaco com subject houston visit soussan looks fine look forward meeting houston new york vince faiz soussan vince j kaminski enron com cc subject houston visit dear vince firstly really appreciate time meeting last week learning enron use leading edge practices quite enlightening truly benefited visit secondly summarized key take aways stated conveying management however really appreciate pls review conclusions ensure miss stated thanks much time wisdom also honored gave copy managing energy price risk book shall reference interest thank really look forward seeing next time houston best regards soussan ps latest fortune article ene great read substantiates company innovative creative approach business may know invited visit enron ene last week met vince kaminski vp head research risk management group ene vince used salomon brothers brain ene w r analytical tools pricing commodities hedging optimization financial physical transactions well value risk systems addition vince received james h mcgraw award energy risk management energy risk manager year well published key contributor best selling publication risk books entitled managing energy price risk meeting mainly focused gaining additional insights leading edge practices within ene key findings summarized ene use corporate price premises use market price info adhere mark market accounting ene uses heath jarrow morton methods modeling price dynamics asked bic copy associated paper home grown software however periodically review selected external developments internal inclusion advancement vince group comprises mathematicians physicists operations researchers responsible development advancement ene risk management tools models religiously used traders risk managers bus across ene investment proposals screened risked roved separate corporate group similar special studies business real options skills work conjunction bus evaluations transactions marked market ene use efficient frontier portfolio concepts vc fund opportunity credible value proposition stand believe current plentiful liquidity market project financing issue good opportunity however closely monitor development opportunity within deep portfolio corporate level know fail fast employee reward system based p ls well creation new business employees stock options really enjoyed visit hope meet vince next time houston

"Subject: re : short - sell vs exercise  chonawee ,  as i have pointed out , short - selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications ( ignoring the legal aspects ) .  suppose the strike is $ 70 and you were granted an atm option .  you sell short at $ 70 ten lots ( one lot = 100 shares ) . the price goes to  $ 100 .  you lose $ 30 x 1000 = $ 30 , 000 on your short position . option exercise  gives you $ 30 , 000 . this is before taxes . you pay taxes  on your option income ( it ' s treated as ordinary income ) . the tax is  28 % x $ 30 , 000 = $ 8 , 400 . you can use only $ 3 , 000 of your loss against  ordinary income . this saves you only $ 840 in taxes .  of course , if you have capital gains , you can use losses on your option  position  as an offset .  the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the  tax benefits over time ( less the time value of money ) , assuming you have  income in the  future ( or capital gains ) .  not so good .  by the way , valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options  is a very interesting and difficult problem .  vince  chonawee supatgiat @ enron  07 / 10 / 2000 11 : 40 am  to : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : short - sell vs exercise  below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere . it  explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised  but cannot be sold . ( as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call  option before its maturity ) . however , after taking vince ' s comments on the  ordinary income / capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good  article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . : - )  - chonawee  short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options  in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when  you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in  fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never  reach this point ( plus interest ) again during the 10 years maturity date or  until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold  on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your  exercise .  however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of  exercising the options , you should short - sell ( or sell ) the stocks in that  amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up ,  you can buy them back ( to cover ) , make profit , and still keep the options . on  the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the  options to cover your short position anytime .  let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends ,  and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as  follow  if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 ,  you would earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 , no  matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover  the short position and still earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . the advantage of  short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can  cover your short position , get ( 70 - 60 ) * 100 = $ 1 , 000 , and still keep your  options or you can exercise the options and gain $ 2 , 500 . that is , you still  keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the  only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your  short position .",0,subject short sell vs exercise chonawee pointed short selling stock may bad decision tax implications ignoring legal aspects suppose strike granted atm option sell short ten lots one lot shares price goes lose x short position option exercise gives taxes pay taxes option income treated ordinary income tax x use loss ordinary income saves taxes course capital gains use losses option position offset remaining part capital loss carried forward get tax benefits time less time value money assuming income future capital gains good way valuation optimal exercise employee stock options interesting difficult problem vince chonawee supatgiat enron stinson gibner hou ect ect vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc subject short sell vs exercise writing originally planned post somewhere explains handle special type call options exercised cannot sold know never optimal exercise call option maturity however taking vince comments ordinary income capital loss tax offsetting issue think good article anymore guess could throw article away chonawee short selling better exercising employee stock options general sensible time exercise employee stock option speculate ene going growth rate extremely low fact exercising options speculating ene would never reach point plus interest years maturity date leave company anticipate hold options gain higher profit delaying exercise however believe ene reaching peak instead exercising options short sell sell stocks amount short selling feel stock starts go buy back cover make profit still keep options hand stock go expect exercise options cover short position anytime let us take look simple case taxes dividends zero risk free rate suppose ene follows simple sample path follow exercise ene options grant price ene reaches would earn short sell ene matter much ene future exercise options cover short position still earn advantage short selling comes ene period point cover short position get still keep options exercise options gain still keep flexibility options short sell conclusion sensible time exercise employee stock options cover short position

"Subject: alliance info alert : richardson and ferc orders  dear generation / power marketing executive :  the following are summaries of two significant activities that occurred  friday , december 15  1 . energy secretary richardson issuance of an emergency order .  ( richardson ' s statement and fpa section 202 ( c ) order is posted on doe ' s  web site at :  http : / / www . energy . gov / hqpress / releaseso 0 / decpr / pro 0309 . html )  2 . ferc ' s 12 / 15 / 00 final order to fix california wholesale markets  ( ferc ' s order can be viewed at  california supplies ordered by richardson  o richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to california iso  o order is effective as soon as iso certifies shortage , but ends 12 / 21 / 00 ,  unless extended  o prices to be agreed to by supplier and iso , or ferc will set rate later  o fpa emergency power authority transferred to doe in 1977  as he said he would on december 13 , u . s . department of energy secretary bill  richardson found "" an emergency exists in california by reason of the shortage  of electric energy "" and issued an emergency order under section 202 ( c ) of  the federal power act ( fpa ) requiring listed generators and marketers to  provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the  california iso . in a statement , richardson said the threat to the  reliability of the california grid requires a long - term solution , but that in  the short - term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts .  the 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the iso certifies to doe that it  has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing  requested service to the iso . the iso must inform each supplier subject to  the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9 : 00 pm ,  eastern standard time , the day before the services are needed . the order  directs the iso to allocate , to the extent feasible , requested services among  subject entities in proportion to each supplier ' s available excess power .  the order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3 : 00 am , eastern  time , december 21 , 2000 , unless extended . to continue to obtain supplies  under this emergency authority , the iso must re - certify the shortage to doe  headquarters every 24 hours .  the terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers  to the iso "" are to be agreed to by the parties . "" if no agreement is reached ,  then under the fpa ' s emergency authority secretary richardson "" will  immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to  the federal energy regulatory commission for a determination at a later date  by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures , and will  prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and  reasonable . "" the authority of ferc to set rates for power supplied under  emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do  not agree to a rate is explicitly included in fpa section 202 ( c ) . the doe  organization act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section  from ferc to doe .  the 76 entities identified in the order ' s attachment are all the entities  that have provided power to the iso over the last 30 days . those entities  are ordered "" to make arrangements to generate , deliver , interchange , and  transmit electric energy when , as , and in such amounts as may be requested by  the "" iso , "" acting as agent for and on behalf of scheduling coordinators . ""  [ source : doe secretary richardson ' s december 14 , 2000 statement and order ;  electric power daily , december 15 , 2000 ]  ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural  reforms  a summary of the december 15 order and commission discussion  at its special meeting today , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly awaited  final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the major  outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to california the  responsibility for addressing state - related matters , as discussed below . at  the same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as  well as the imposition of region - wide price caps .  ferc reiterated the november 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances ,  california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates  due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in  conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west .  while all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus - based outcome  that appropriately balanced all competing interests , each commissioner  expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order . chairman  hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement , while comms .  hebert and massey laid out their positions where they believed the commission  had either "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , just as they did on  november 1 , as discussed below .  highlights of key actions :  ( 1 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to eliminate , effective immediately ,  the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities  buy and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to  purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative  mechanisms to manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules  effective at the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman  hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california  wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning  ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public  utilities commission ( cpuc ) .  ( 2 ) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""  proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a  "" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which  incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be  in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next  year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can  be place by the may 1 , deadline .  in a major modification , ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that  while certain refund conditions will continue to apply , unless ferc issues  written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under  review , refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days .  as proposed , however , supply bids in excess of $ 150 will be prohibited from  setting the market - clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above  $ 150 / mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential ,  weekly basis and provide certain cost support .  ( 3 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of  independent , non - stakeholder governing board for the iso . the iso governing  board must relinquish their decision - making power and operating control to  the iso management on january 29 , 2001 . a future order will set procedures  for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process .  ( 4 ) in a major modification , ferc adopted a $ 74 / mwh "" price benchmark "" for  assessing prices of five - year energy supply contracts . this benchmark will  be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of  pricing long - term contracts .  to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable  rates , ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market  participants .  ( 5 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to  schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and  instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent  of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the  real - time spot market .  ( 6 ) ferc directed the iso and the three investor - owned utilities to file  generation interconnection standards .  ( 7 ) ferc affirmed the longer - term measures proposed in the november 1 order ,  including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2 ,  2001 .  ( 8 ) ferc deferred resolving key issues , including establishing new iso board  selection procedures , developing appropriate market monitoring measures and  negotiating protective orders associated with data collection .  ( 9 ) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to  resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability  of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand  responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of  sufficient reserve requirements .  commissioner responses  comm . hebert reluctantly concurred , calling the final order a "" missed  opportunity "" to , among other things , send appropriate signals for new  generation siting and conservation . reiterating his november 1 concerns ,  hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission  should and should not have adopted . while expressing pleasure at the tone of  the order ( "" balanced and considerate "" ) , the bid certainly reversal , and the  role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board , hebert  nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order , which  he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low . hebert faulted the commission  for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order  approving the ca iso ' s emergency $ 250 / mwh "" soft cap "" proposal . hebert ended  by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to  forward contract , including easing the existing prudence review requirements .  comm . breathitt endorsed the order , reiterating her support for progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that the order properly  "" walked the line "" by taking all of the competing interests into account ,  calling it less than ideal , but a step in the right direction . she also  concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will  be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of  the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint . additionally she mentioned that any price below the  $ 74 / mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable .  comm . massey concurred , but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for  california ratepayers , stating that he felt that market power had been  exercised , that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers  had profited too much at the expense of others in the market . he warned  that , as he understood the legal precedents , the federal courts were poised  to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on  to consumers . on the positive side , he approved of the de - federalization of  60 % of the market and the creation of long term contracts . however , he  emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of  creating more generation and transmission . in the long term , comm . massey  hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference  and that the market would have rules more like pjm .  finally , comm . massey articulated what he would have liked to have done  differently . he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not  enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the  on - going investigation . he also disagreed with the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint ,  preferring instead a hard price per generator . the commissioner said he  would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and  that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west . finally ,  he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds .  chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced  to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high . he feels that it is  now time for the state regulators and markets to act . he noted that by  shrinking the cal px , the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the  long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the  least amount of damage to the utilities . in regards to suggestions for a  regional price cap , the chairman stated that this would not work due to the  fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville , wapa and the  public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest .  however , he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to  address regional issues . finally , in conceptually addressing the california  situation , the chairman stated that competition or "" deregulation "" did not  fail in california , but that there never was competition in california .",0,subject alliance info alert richardson ferc

2 ) waive prior notice requirements for any on - site or  self - generators that sell at wholesale within the wscc area ; 3 ) grant blanket  market - based rate authority for sales on the wholesale market of electric  energy that becomes available as a result of demand - response reductions in  retail and wholesale loads ; and 4 ) broadening and extending through december  31 , 2001 the temporary waivers of the operating and efficiency standards for  qualifying facilities ( qfs ) to increase the availability of generating  capacity .  ferc seeks comments by march 30 on a series of economic incentives aimed at  ensuring timely upgrades to the western transmission grid , including an  increased rate of return on equity ( roe ) for projects that significantly  increase transmission and can be in service by either june 1 , 2001 , or  november 1 , 2001 . other areas that ferc requested comment on include the use  of interconnection authority under the federal power act , and to raise the  dollar limits on the issuance of blanket certificates authorizing gas  pipeline construction . on hydro issues , ferc requested comment on ways to  increase operating flexibility at ferc - licensed projects while protecting  environmental resources .  in its effort to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure , ferc  asked for comments - again by march 30 - on a series of economic incentives  aimed at ensuring upgrades to the western interconnection , including the  increased roe for projects that significantly increase transmission on  constrained paths and can be in service by the above dates in 2001 .  increased roe , ferc said , will also be given to system upgrades over new  transmission paths that can be in service by june 1 , 2002 , or november 1 ,  2002 . ferc seeks comment on a proposed 10 - year depreciation period for  projects that increase transmission capacity in the short - term and a 15 - year  depreciation period for upgrades involving new rights - of - way that can be of  service by november 1 , 2002 .  in his dissent to the order , commissioner massey argued the order focuses on  "" quick fixes , "" and that the measures will not close the gap between supply in  demand in california . the order also "" fails to address price relief , "" noted  massey . massey also called for a full federal power act ( fpa ) section 206  investigation of california issues , which would allow for the possibility of  refunds . on transmission incentive provisions , massey lamented that the  proposed roe increase to 14 percent appeared arbitrary and inconsistent with  ferc policy under order no . 2000 . the financial provisions , he said ,  appeared to be "" just throwing money at the problem . "" while generally  disappointed with the order , massey did express limited support for many  parts of the order . many of the suggestions in the order are the "" same  actions as authorized last may , "" said massey . "" they were good ideas then ,  and they are good ideas now , "" he concluded .  for his part in comments at the open meeting when the order was adopted ,  chairman hebert said the order was designed to "" squeeze every additional mw  of supply available "" and to encourage the conservation of mw , and stressed  that ferc is "" doing all it can in its power to alleviate western problems . ""  he said the order seeks to eradicate the projected supply shortfall in  california , but noted that generation / transmission siting , and conservation  are generally state issues .  ferc ' s * removing obstacles * order is posted on its web site at :  citation : ferc issued is order removing obstacles to increased electric  generation and natural gas supply in the western united states and asking for  comments was issued on march 14 , 2001 , docket no . elol - 47 - 000 .  a detailed analysis and summary of the specific actions taken and proposals  made follows :  electric transmission infrastructure  within 30 days , the california iso and transmission owners in wscc are to  prepare and file for information purposes a list of grid enhancement projects  that may be underway or may not require initial siting and acquisition of  rights of way .  ferc proposes a scaled transmission infrastructure incentive under which  transmission owners of projects that increase transmission capacity at  present constraints and can be in service by july 1 , 2001 would receive a  cost - based rate reflecting a 300 basis point premium return on equity and a  10 - year depreciable life . projects in service by november 1 , 2001 , would get  a 200 basis point premium and 10 - year depreciable life . ferc would use a  uniform baseline return on equity for all jurisdictional transmission  providers in wscc of 11 . 5 % , based on the roe ferc approved for southern  california edison .  system upgrades that involve new rights of way , add significant transfer  capability and can be in service by november 1 , 2002 , would get a cost - based  rate reflecting 12 . 5 % roe , or al 00 basis point premium , and 15 - year  depreciable life .  facilities needed to interconnect new supply to the grid , which go into  service as required to accommodate the in - service date of the new plant would  get a cost - based rate that reflected a 13 . 5 % roe , or a 200 basis point  premium , if in service by november 1 , 2001 and 12 . 5 % roe if in service by  november 1 , 2002 .  for increases in transmission capacity on constrained interfaces that do not  involve significant capital investments , for example , installing new  technology , ferc proposes to allow transmission owners to increase the  revenue requirement of their network service rates to ensure that each  additional mw of capacity will generate revenues equal to their current firm  point - to - point rate . ferc requests comment on whether to assign the cost of  any interconnection or system upgrade to a particular load or supply , or  alternatively , to roll these costs into the average system rate .  extension of waivers for qfs  ferc proposes to extend its temporary waivers of operating and efficiency  standards for qfs - applicable throughout wscc - to allow increased  generation through december 31 , 2001 . the waivers were to expire on april  30 , 2001 . the proposed waiver would allow qualifying cogenerators to sell  their output above the level at which they have historically supplied this  output to purchasing utility . the waiver for qualifying small power  production facilities in wscc with respect to their fuel use requirements  under ferc regulation section 292 . 204 ( b ) , would be extended to december 31 ,  2001 .  additional capacity from on - site generation  ferc will adopt streamlined regulatory procedure to accommodate wholesale  sales from such facilities that serve load within wscc . through december 31 ,  2001 , owners of generating facilities located at business locations in wscc  and used primarily for back - up or self - generation who would become subject  to fpa by virtue of sales of such power will be permitted to sell power at  wholesale without prior notice under fpa section 205 . ferc also authorizes  such power to be sold at market - based rates . ferc waives its prior notice  requirement for mutually agreed upon interconnection agreements for  interconnections necessary to accomplish these sales . quarterly reporting is  required .  allows demand response bidding  ferc will allow retail customers , as permitted by state law , and wholesale  customers to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load  reduction at wholesale . ferc is granting blanket authorization , consistent  with its prior discussion on sales from on - site generation and requires  similar reporting .  ferc ' s december 15 order on the california market directed , as a longer - term  measure that the iso pursue establishing an integrated day - ahead market in  which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue . ferc seeks  comments on the desirability of accelerating action on this .  ferc says it realizes that states play an important role in regulating retail  electric service and that allowing retail load to reduce consumption for  resale in wholesale markets raises legal , commercial , technical and  regulatory issues . safeguards may be needed to protect and enhance retail  demand - response bidding programs . intention is not to undermine state  programs but to promote the necessary complementary wholesale programs .  requests comments on how helpful this action is and how it can be  accomplished consistent with state jurisdiction over retail sales .  contract modifications for demand - response bidding  there may be opportunities for public utilities to make other types of  demand - response arrangements with their wholesale customers . as for mutually  agreeable qf interconnections , ferc will waive prior notice requirement for  any mutually agreeable demand - response related rate schedule amendments that  may be required to effectuate these arrangements . clarifies that  demand - response program costs should be treated consistently with all other  types of incremental and out - of - pocket costs .  interconnections  fpa section 210 ( d ) allows ferc to issue an order requiring interconnection if  it makes a finding that such an order : 1 ) is in the public interest ; 2 ) would  encourage overall conservation of energy or capital , optimize the efficiency  of use of facilities and resources , or improve the reliability of any  electric utility system or federal power marketing agency to which the order  applies ; and 3 ) meets the requirements of fpa section 212 .  ferc requests comments on whether it can use this authority under fpa section  210 ( d ) to alleviate existing impediments to electricity reaching load . if  the exercise of this authority may be warranted , ferc seeks comments on  whether it could make some of the required findings generically for the wscc  region in order to respond quickly should circumstances arise requiring  immediate action .  longer term regional solutions  ferc believes an rto for the entire western region or the seamless  integration of western rtos is the best vehicle for designing and  implementing a long - term regional solution .  natural gas pipeline capacity  ferc has realigned its resources to respond to new applications for gas  pipeline capacity and is soliciting comments on ways to expedite the approval  of pipeline infrastructure needed to serve california and the west . requests  comments on how it might further exercise its authority over new pipeline  construction to alleviate the present crisis , including increasing the dollar  limit thresholds for blanket certificates to $ 10 million , and for prior  notice authorizations to $ 30 million in order to increase the facilities  qualifying for automatic authorization ; offering blanket certificates for  construction or acquisition of portable compressor stations to enhance  pipeline capacity to california ; and offering rate incentives to expedite  construction of projects that will make additional capacity available this  summer on constrained pipeline systems .  hydroelectric power  ferc staff will hold a conference to discuss methods to address environmental  protection at hydro projects while allowing increased generation . requests  comments on ways to allow for greater operating flexibility at  commission - licensed hydro projects while protecting environmental resources .  comments should consider : 1 ) methods for agency involvement ; 2 ) ways to  handle and expedite endangered species act consultations ; 3 ) criteria for  modifying licenses ; and 4 ) identification of processes that could be  implemented to provide efficiency upgrades .  oil pipelines  ferc will explore with oil pipelines innovative proposals that could lead to  ensuring an adequate flow of petroleum product into the california market .  conference with state commissioners  ferc will hold a one - day conference with state commissioners and other state  representatives from western states to discuss price volatility in the west  as well as other ferc - related issues identified by the governors of western  states . by notice issued march 16 , this meeting is scheduled for april 6 ,  2001 in boise , idaho .

( enron ' s interests probably lie mainly in the first stem . )  in morning of the first day , researchers from universities  presented their project proposals . i found some of them  quite interesting . for example , shmuel oren , fernando alvarado ,  tim mount ( of cornell ) propose to study "" market redesign : incorporating  the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market  design , "" shijie deng , s . oren et al propose to study "" power asset  valuation model in a market - based and reliability - constrained electric  power system . "" the first got funded but the second did not .  in the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their  own discussion . i went to the academic discussion and lance the  industry one . i hope my presence there did not make things worse , for  the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion .  the proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants .  the proposal process goes as follows : researchers first write a short  proposal to appropriate stem committee ( no industry participantion , it seems  to me ) ,  each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4 . the  selected  proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry . industry then  gets to vote which proposals get funded . however , some researchers were  very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process . there were  accusation of self - ranking , communication between stem committee and  member schools breaking down , and so on . some were even asking for  some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before wrting it  ( the arguement was "" then it was a waste of our time to write proposals "" ,  which i found quite amusing ) .  all in all , i found the process was not taken seriously enough by university  researchers . pserc has been established for 5 years now and it still does  not have a proper proposal screen process , which is hard to believe . also ,  the communication among university researchers , between stem committee  and member schools , and most importantly , between researchers and industry ,  are not smooth as all .  since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members , the "" right ""  projects may not get funded . too many participants also make the decision  process very indecisive and quite painful to watch ( lance can comment on  this better ) . they also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which  made the voting a less authoritive .  i believe enron will not get much returns from join pserc ( price tag is  $ 40 , 000  per company per year ) . if we find some projects interesting , we can sponsor  the schools in the form of summer interns , the schools claim that most of the  fund  goes to support students anyway .  alex",0,subject pserc denver meeting vince pserc meeting lance went interesting boring pserc school members industry members research program consists three stems markets transmission distribution systems enron interests probably lie mainly first stem morning first day researchers universities presented project proposals found quite interesting example shmuel oren fernando alvarado tim mount cornell propose study market redesign incorporating lessons learned actual experiences enhancing market design shijie deng oren et al propose study power asset valuation model market based reliability constrained electric power system first got funded second afternoon industry academic separated discussion went academic discussion lance industry one hope presence make things worse discussion revealed lot organizational chaos confusion proposal screen process got lot heat participants proposal process goes follows researchers first write short proposal appropriate stem committee industry participantion seems committee ranks proposal selects top selected proposals expanded present industry industry gets vote proposals get funded however researchers unhappy initial ranking selection process accusation self ranking communication stem committee member schools breaking even asking sort assurance project funded even wrting arguement waste time write proposals found quite amusing found process taken seriously enough university researchers pserc established years still proper proposal screen process hard believe also communication among university researchers stem committee member schools importantly researchers industry smooth since proposals voted industry members right projects may get funded many participants also make decision process indecisive quite painful watch lance comment better also wanted spread fund among schools made voting less authoritive believe enron get much returns join pserc price tag per company per year find projects interesting sponsor schools form summer interns schools claim fund goes support students anyway alex

"Subject: alliance info alert - ferc reporting  attached is a summary of recent ferc activities ( pdf file ) and the weekly  alliance express . the following is a summary of the most recent ferc meeting ,  followed by a listing of the most recent ferc filings .  in a brief meeting yesterday , ferc approved a final rule adopting section 203  merger filing requirements , generally as proposed , and extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time that the new york market can be  determined to be "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a  technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and  urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next  steps , and deadlines for resolution / implementation . additional details are  provided below .  ferc updates , streamlines merger filing process  ferc unanimously approved its proposed order revising the reporting  requirements for mergers . however , comm . hebert did so with reservations , as  discussed below . commission staff stated that the order closely follows the  notice of proposed rulemaking previously issued , but adds more detail and  more certainty to the industry . staff stated that the order is improved over  the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain  entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products .  according to ferc , the draft order :  - revises the commission ' s filing requirements to reflect existing merger  policy based on ferc ' s 1996 merger policy guidelines ;  - provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market  analyses . the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with  potential horizontal competitive concerns . in addition , the rule establishes  informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses .  - streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise  competitive concerns ; and  - reduces the industry ' s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing  requirements .  the rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal  register .  commissioner reaction :  comm . hebert expressed reservations that , although he was voting for the  rule , ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice ( doj ) and the  federal trade commission ( ftc ) market concentration analyses and that ferc  should follow the lead of anti - trust enforcement officials , who could also  analyze mergers faster and more confidentially . he also stated that ferc  should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them , not before ,  and that there should be a definite time frame for review . hebert did  mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission  assets would be exempt , that ancillary services would be considered as a  separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative  market analysis .  comm . breathitt supported the final rule , stating that it should expedite the  approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the  fact that older , irrelevant requirements have been dropped . she indicated  that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting  the public interest by stating that the process will be "" efficient yet  sufficient "" . the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule  addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail  competition and one of her main concerns , confidentiality .  comm . massey fully supported the final rule , emphasizing that it would  improve response time , lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the  industry to better predict commission actions . like commissioner breathitt ,  massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that  will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants  to point to other factors when concentration appears too high . massey also  stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc ' s  concerns , such as future mergers when they occur in succession , retail  competition , mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and  analysis of ancillary services . in sum , he averred that the order will  provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis , while taking into  consideration the rapid changes in the industry .  chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was  a very important rule . in response to comm . hebert , chairman hoecker said  that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc ' s report before issuing their  own , that the anti - trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc ' s expertise when  reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries . there is a major  positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are  reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work , he noted . because the  rtos enlarge the size of the subject market , he indicated , rtos will help to  preserve competition . therefore , more and larger rtos should allow for more  mergers , he said . the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that  joining an rto is a requirement for a merger , but that it would certainly be  viewed favorably .  nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably  competitive  in a 3 - 1 decision , with comm . hebert dissenting , ferc extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be  "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a technical  conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market  participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and  deadlines for resolution / implementation .  in so doing , ferc rejected certain aspects of nyiso ' s september 1 and 8 , 2000  compliance filing , submitted pursuant to its may 31 , 2000 order imposing a  temporary bid cap through october 31 . the iso ' s efforts to correct market  flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had  not yet satisfied the commission ' s directives , ferc concluded . ferc found  that while nyiso has achieved solid progress in certain areas , overall the  iso has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then  gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the iso ' s non - spinning reserve  market by april 2001 , as the iso requested .  commissioner reaction :  comms . hoecker , massey and breathitt all endorsed the order as an "" imperfect  solution , "" yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the  iso ' s market . comm . hebert faulted the commission for squandering an  opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls .  hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack  of the iso ' s progress , but contended that significant outstanding issues must  be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted .  in other action , ferc accepted nyiso ' s and nepool ' s proposed emergency energy  transaction agreement , allowing nyiso and iso - ne to provide emergency service  to each other ( ero 0 - 3638 - 000 ) ;  stricken items included cae - 16 ( nepool ' s 64 th agreement amendment proposing  the elimination of in service and instituting new rules governing certain  import transactions ( ero 0 - 3577 - 000 ) ) .  = = recent ferc filings = =  ( 1 ) rto developments  * iso ne submitted its changes to market rule 17 , market monitoring ,  reporting and market power mitigation , in compliance with the commission ' s  july 26 , 2000 order . erol - 368 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * iso ne submitted its special interim market rule in compliance with the  commission ' s july 26 , 2000 order . ero 0 - 369 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * illinois industrial energy consumers filed to intervene regarding dynegy ' s  filing to request approval for the withdrawal of the illinois power co . from  the miso . erol - 123 - 000 . filed november 6 , 2000 .  * el segundo power filed a motion "" requesting order on request for rehearing  by date certain "" in complaint that challenges the ca iso ' s ability to set the  rates for the energy that it can compel generators to produce for reliability  under its standard form contract . ero 0 - 1830 - 001 . filed november 3 , 2000 .  * ca iso filed an unbundled grid management charge in order to recover its  administrative and operating costs . erol - 313 - 000 . comments due by november  22 , 2000 .  * nepool submitted supplemental information related to its filing of the  sixty - fourth agreement amending the nepool agreement , which proposed the  elimination of in service . ero 0 - 3577 - 000 . comments due by november 14 , 2000 .
