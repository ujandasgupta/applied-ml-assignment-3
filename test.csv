"Subject: eol wti historical trade simulation - more profitable trading  strategy  please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue , which contains some  typos .  greg and john ,  i found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of  trades ( keeping the  total volume per day constant ) , we can be more profitable . this is partially  because in a trending market  we lose less money by following the market more closely . for example , suppose  market move from  $ 30 to $ 35 . if per trade volume is 10 , 000 bbl and the half bid - offer spread  is $ 1 for simplicity , we take 5  trades of short positions , the total mtm for that day is  ( - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) * 10 , 000 = - $ 150 , 000 and total trading  volume is 50 , 000 bbl short . if per trade volume is 50 , 000 bbl , we take one  trade , the total mtm is  - 5 * 50 , 000 = - $ 250 , 000 . thus the net difference between the two trading  strategies is $ 10 , 000 for that  particular day .  therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the  number of trades , we can be more  profitable as a market maker .  i rerun a scenario that stinson sent to you on dec . 27 where he used per  trade volume of 30 , 000 bbl .  i reduce the number of trade to 10 , 000 while increasing the number of trades  by factor of 3 . almost in all  cases , i saw increased profitability . see the colume marked "" change "" for  dollar amount change in millions .  please let stinson or me know your thoughts on this .  regards ,  zimin lu  x 36388  as compared to",0,subject eol wti historical trade simulation profitable trading strategy please ignor previous mail regarding issue contains typos greg john found reducing volume per trade increasing daily number trades keeping total volume per day constant profitable partially trending market lose less money following market closely example suppose market move per trade volume bbl half bid offer spread simplicity take trades short positions total mtm day total trading volume bbl short per trade volume bbl take one trade total mtm thus net difference two trading strategies particular day therefore seems reducing per trade volume increasing number trades profitable market maker rerun scenario stinson sent dec used per trade volume bbl reduce number trade increasing number trades factor almost cases saw increased profitability see colume marked change dollar amount change millions please let stinson know thoughts regards zimin lu x compared

( i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward . )  i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of  our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the  same  time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business .  if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest  you  begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar .  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar .  thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later .  thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting  that  i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show  anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .  dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc .  27121 adonna ct .  los altos hills , ca 94022  ( 650 ) 218 -

"Subject: re : lng may 19 decision  john ,  sorry for the confusion .  this is a second tanker on which very few details  are available . the lng group is working as we speak  to provide some information for joe sutton before  his departure for paris this ( tuesday ) afternoon .  there is no dash on this 2 nd tanker yet . i asked dave gorte  on monday to send me one and was not told that  he can provide me with the mystic lady dash as the closest  substitute .  vince  john sherriff  05 / 16 / 2000 12 : 20 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : re : lng may 19 decision  vince - thanks for the update . what i am not sure of is what if any decision  has to be  made on may 19 . it seems to me that the mystic lady and elba island deals  have already  been approved and executed - but it is quite likely i am missing a detail or  two .  john  vince j kaminski  15 / 05 / 2000 17 : 14  to : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , david gorte / hou / ect @ ect , rick  buy / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect  subject : re : lng may 19 decision  john ,  this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions .  1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash  and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the  decision  to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island  project ( please , see point 2 ) .  2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest  ( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island  transaction . the next step  will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions  in one place and  to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is  meeting to close a few  remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 .  a few comments on the book design and my view of the project :  a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island  facility  by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent  supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term  contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions .  the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long - term  contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are  setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos  but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and  coordinating  the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words ,  we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction .  b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension  option of  5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we  have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for  such a long tenor . this is  essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread  and  i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread .  one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the  first  5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side .  c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions  regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a  big prudence reserve  in case we mark it to market .  d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island  deal  ( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions .  long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail  that  correlates very well with brent .  vince  john sherriff  05 / 14 / 2000 01 : 40 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : lauren urquhart / lon / ect @ ect  subject : lng may 19 decision  vince  i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well .  anyway with greg moving to his  new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the  eastern hemishere plus lng .  i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for  lng and lng ship values . i also understand  that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far  away ) . anway i understand this  is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you  please let me know where you stand now ?

"Subject: re : uk power / gas  vince , just fyi :  oliver ( risk control in london ) was asking if it is appropriate to use a set  of factors corresponding to some commodity for another commodity .  this "" mapping "" we do quite frequently in our var system when forward prices  for a commodity are not correlated ( because of poor price history ) .  i think using this kind of mappings is ok because we can not trust these  correlations based on illiquid price information .  if we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in  the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 factors - then  we might use more factors then 7 or the matrix itself .  tanya  tanya tamarchenko  12 / 15 / 2000 02 : 36 pm  to : oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect  cc : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , rudi zipter / hou / ect @ ect , wenyao  jia / hou / ect @ ect , kirstee hewitt / lon / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect ,  naveen andrews / corp / enron @ enron  subject : re : uk power / gas  oliver ,  i completely agree with you : validating var inputs like positions , prices and  volatilities which are used by risktrac is the first thing to do .  you also rise a valid question : if the factor loadings for some commodity do  not make sense should we use the factor loadings for another commodity ?  the factor loadings "" do not make sense "" when the correlations across the term  structure are not high . so if we believe that the forward prices for this  commodity are market prices and statistical analysis on these prices produces  the correlations which we trust , then it would be proper to use this  correlation matrix in var engine , not the factors . using factors is simply  the way to speed up calculations for highly correlated prices without  sacrificing the accuracy .  tanya .  oliver gaylard  12 / 15 / 2000 07 : 11 am  to : naveen andrews / corp / enron @ enron  cc : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , rudi zipter / hou / ect @ ect , wenyao  jia / hou / ect @ ect , kirstee hewitt / lon / ect @ ect , tanya tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect ,  ganapathy ramesh / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect  subject : re : uk power / gas  naveen  regarding the calculation of uk vars in risk trac i agree that we should be  using this calculation engine for all commodity vars . however we should not  focus solely on the uk but ensure that we use risk trac for continental power  and gas , uk power and gas , nordic power .  to use risk trac i think the following need to be resolved first , to  implement it "" right the first time "" , as i think it is incorrect to consider  the risk trac numbers "" as the most accurate "" since it depends on the validity  of these items :  positions ( delta and gamma ) and curve mapping - these need to include all  positions including those outside the main risk systems  positions , curves and mapping should now be no problem given the feeds ,  apart from continental power , have been uat ' d and we have the spreadsheet  feeds up and running .  price and vol curves - as used by the risk systems  as above  inter commodity correlation - prompt month  correlation should be easy to calculate given an accurate and complete data  set ( however the incomplete historic data for europe in risk trac , prior to  the formation of the task force , would mean a full data set needs to be  obtained and used ) . term structure of correlation would be good but i  understand this is difficult to use in the calculation .  factor loadings  i think factor loadings should be calculated , on the same data sets used  for inter commodity correlation , for all commodities . if this analysis does  not appear to work i am not sure that using factor loadings for other markets  is adequate . do we need to consider an alternative approach to calculating  var for these markets ?  to ensure this moves forward i think a list of the mile stones ,  responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up otherwise i fear the  process of moving across to risk trac from the spreadsheet var will  experience some slippage .  i will call today to start the process off .  rgds  oliver  naveen andrews @ enron  06 / 12 / 2000 21 : 50  to : oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect  cc : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , rudi zipter / hou / ect @ ect , wenyao  jia / hou / ect @ ect , kirstee hewitt / lon / ect @ ect , tanya tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect ,  ganapathy ramesh / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect  subject : uk power / gas  oliver ,  i had a couple of issues pertaining to uk power / uk gas . first ,  just a few notes as it pertains to risk trac uk - implementation :  ( 1 ) in risktrac , currently all the gas curves are mapped to nbp .  ( 2 ) all the power curves are mapped to r 4 ( cinergy ) .  factor loading analysis lends itself only to nbp and the norewgian curves ( for  reasons of liquidity , etc ) . we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the  best curves available at this time .  the spreadsheet which is utilized in the uk also has curves mapped to a  2 - 3 - year old set of factors derived from us nat gas , which is clearly not  optimal . hence  ( 1 ) we should be using risktrac numbers for var , as it is the "" most  accurate "" , both in terms of ene - wide model usage and in terms of the most  recent updated data . ever since uk power came on board in risktrac 3 weeks  ago , the uk power number has been consistently 7 - 8 mm above the numbers in  your spreadsheet . this difference is to be ecpected , given the different  inputs .  ( 2 ) the consistent numbers do not point to a data error in any obvious way ,  however , if you believe that positions are not captured correctly , please let  our it staff know that .

"Subject: california on the brink - - cera alert  cera alert : december 13 , 2000  title : california on the brink  cera knowledge areas : western energy , n . american power , n . american gas  california on the brink  the california stalemate  california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over  credit - worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would  avoid selling to the california market . while numerous factors have  contributed to the high cost of power incurred by california ' s utilities , the  root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation . the current  credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address  the situation . the collective efforts of all market participants should be  focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible .  western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this  summer . perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california  consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis ,  regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and  significant rate increases . the california public utilities commission denied  the requests of pacific gas & electric and southern california edison to end  their rate freezes , forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance  the costs of higher wholesale energy . this has created an unsustainable  accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market .  the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the  galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to  address the underlying structural problems in the industry . however , there is  no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective  solution for customers and the industry as a whole . wholesale and retail  markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain  muddled . in the necessarily political process that will follow , it is  possible that - as has largely been the case so far - the steps taken will fail  to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will  instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws .  in the six months since california ' s supply shortfall began plaguing western  markets , regulators have done little to address the underlying problem .  rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage - establishing a market  environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and  demand side responses - efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for  the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers . indeed ,  several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by  discouraging new power plant additions . these include price caps , repeated  changes to market rules , attempts to seize generator profits , and a  challenging siting and permitting process .  medicine worse than the illness  several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were  accompanied by very few additions to the supply base . regulators did not pay  adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall . the void of consensus  over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of  bandaid remedies that address the symptoms , but not the cause , of  california ' s electric market woes . *  * challenging siting and permitting . despite state action to better  coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants , power  plant developers still face high hurdles . local community opposition alone  has struck down some key proposed facilities .  * price caps discourage investment . state and federal proposals to cap prices  limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market , especially  for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment  to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state .  * repeated rule changes . frequent rule changes in the iso markets ( including  the price caps ) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new  plant development .  * calls for refunds . despite reports by the power exchange , the iso , and the  ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the  california markets , state officials continue to accuse power providers of  gaming the market . calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits  are a threat to new plant development .  * facility inspections . recent inspections of power plants by state officials  to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of  their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust .  cera ' s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west  are not guaranteed ? to make a profit . prospects of new plant profitability  are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants , decommissioning of  older units , demand growth , and numerous other difficult - to - forecast factors .  california ' s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of  financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers  considering entering the state .  despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in  the state with a special , limited - term capacity payment , cera estimates that  demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001 .  in addition , the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a  sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the  earliest . therefore , three years remain before a sufficient quantity of  capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk  of an outage .  the road to recovery  there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity  shortfall :  * encourage new build . supply must be part of the answer . this requires a  series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build . while in principal  some have been taken , such as new fast track approval , the success of these  actions can only be measured by the build itself . for now , there is still not  enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness . ?  * stabilize investment climate . utilities must have assurance that they will  ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power . this provides the  credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new  build .  * move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios . one of the reasons the  pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence  ( and even discouragement ) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in  the state - particularly for residential and small commercial customers . with  the market at a peak , however , now is in one sense a sub - optimal time to move  toward term contracting . yet these contracts provide the foundation for a  series of actions - including new supply build and demand side investments . if  they end up above market , they will at least have achieved the desired effect  of knocking down prices , a fact which by itself should provide sufficient  justification for recovering the cost of these commitments .  * encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response . although  originally a feature of california ' s market design , most consumers are  insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates . exposing  customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a  demand response .  * encourage market mechanisms that dampen the "" boom bust "" characteristic of  the market . whether in the form of a capacity payment , a reserve requirement ,  or a minimum term portfolio requirement , the california power market needs to  move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the  market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to  elicit new investment . such a structure can help dampen ( but not eliminate )  future price volatility .  * avoid continuously tinkering with the market . while the market does need to  be restructured as described above , it also needs to be stable and reliable  to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long - term  contractual market for power in california . continually tinkering with the  market structure - such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since  july - only serves to undermine confidence in the market . california needs to  do its best to develop a long - term solution and then let the market run its  course .  * allow for greater environmental flexibility . the state should explore a  more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply  shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to  emissions restrictions .  * free purpa power plants to generate . relief should be granted to purpa  power plants that are operational , but are restricted by contract from  operating to generate only power .  * * end * *  this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours .  this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information  from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"Subject: pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to ,  which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating / score to price .  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model .  building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural  nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and  software packages to use ?

"Subject: re : preface for book  julie ,  the introduction looks fine . i have made some cosmetic changes  ( typos and split infinitives that slipped by ) . you can safely ignore most of  them .  english is not even my second language .  the corrections are in pink .  vince  "" julie "" on 08 / 01 / 2000 07 : 43 : 10 am  to : "" vincejkaminski ""  cc :  subject : preface for book  vince ,  ?  hope you are well .  ?  we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and  you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the  preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .  ?  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  ?  ?  preface  ?  ?  ?  one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide  range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose  consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs .  ?  in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?  in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout  the book .  ?  in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility  and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated .  ?  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?  this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility .  ?  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such  curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial  markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric  approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors .  ?  chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options , and ladder options .  ?  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model .  ?  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options .  ?  chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach  results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .  ?  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  )  illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  ?  chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,  historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .  ?  finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  ?  before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are  certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated

"Subject: re : wall street micro news report  homeland security investments  the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have  changed  the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and  logical  security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in  the  banking , national resource and government sectors . according to giga ,  a  wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for  information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by  2005 .  homeland security investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing  our  readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this  lucrative sector . as we know , events related to homeland security  happen  with lightning speed . what we as investors can do is position  ourselves in  such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to  capitalize on events which have yet to happen . homeland security  investments is here to help our readers do just that .  with this in mind , it is with great excitement that we present vinoble ,  inc .  this stock is expected to do big things in both the near and long  terms .  symbol : ( vnbl )  current price : 0 . 08  short term target price : 0 . 35  12 month target price : 1 . 20  * * * why we believe vnbl . ob will give big returns on investment * * *  * at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency  identification ) technology . this is technology which uses tiny sensors  to  transmit information about a person or object wirelessly .  * vnbl is already an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location  technology .  * vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies  and  governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources . such  technology  has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials  designated "" high risk "" were they to fall into the wrong hands .  * vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order  to  create "" high security space "" in locales where it is deemed necessary .  locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea  ports ,  mines , nuclear facilities , and more .  * as with all stocks , news drives the short term price . fresh news has  made vnbl a hot buy .  news on vnbl  malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 2005 - - vinoble , inc .  ( otcbb : vnbl -  news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth  opportunities  in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and  other  security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and  services that will assist in the automation of the identification and  control of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in  the  oil & gas and petrochemical industries .  although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines  and  equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they  can  also deliver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in  different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of  specific  liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise  opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,  such as  a well filling with water .  as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide  the  safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the  entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is  essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would  enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or  danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that  can  operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions , but gives  valuable  safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid  can  also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and  chemical  products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level .  vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are  more  than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective  measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against  threat .  preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of  u . s .  industry and economy .  the company believes that such offering service and technology  application  in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position  vinoble in  a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the  increasing capital and global spending that the company will require  for  growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at  a  cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to  do  without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of  constant threat .  this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is  exceptional . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly  innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock .  information within this email contains "" forward looking statements ""  within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and  section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that  express or involve discussions with respect to predictions ,  expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals ,  assumptions or  future  events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be  "" forward looking statements .

"Subject: comments  hi sheridan ,  how are you ? i hope that you had a good vacation . vasant and i looked at  your memo and found it to be interesting . i shall first briefly summarize  our understanding of the methodology you propose . the comments follow .  finally , i shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case  in further refining the model .  it appears that you are proposing a state - space approach where probabilities  of different states at various future dates are specified . the next step is  to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the  branches from the origin to one of the terminal points . traversing through  the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the  average present value of the project . also , you are using the simulation to  assign a value of the project to each node . thus each node will have a cash  flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value  which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward . if some  of these values turn out to be negative , zero - coupon , risk - free bonds are  purchased to neutralize the negative realization .  next , we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our  project ( based on the variance of the returns ) . we iterate until  convergence .  finally , we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital  from the pv of the gross cash flows ( including debt ) to determine if the  project merits further consideration .  comments / clarifications  1 . the money is being set aside to avoid negative values . it is not clear  if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node . anyhow , we  shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at  that cross - section of time as the risk - free asset pays in all states of  nature . this will have to be done every time there is a negative  realization . thus , for the typical project we have , the value of risk  capital may be extremely high , as we are not following a tail - based norm  anymore .  2 . your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all  values being positive . if so , we are only issuing risk - free debt . also , a  project with a single negative value at each cross - section of time will not  have a positive debt capacity .  3 . it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate , which is  obtained in each step from the comparison investment ( by equating the  variances ) . it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an  effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence . also ,  our project has a finite life and the market - based assets will have infinite  lives . in the light of this fact , how will we define the relevant variance ?  is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment ?  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment  and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this model closely  resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines  the discount rate .  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available from  the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as the  profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or  less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field to be 10  years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable operating costs .  it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this  problem .  do let me know if you have further questions .  rakesh",0,subject comments hi sheridan hope good vacation vasant looked memo found interesting shall first briefly summarize understanding methodology propose comments follow finally shall sketch simple gas field project use test case refining model appears proposing state space approach probabilities different states various future dates specified next step assume discount rate compute present value following branches origin one terminal points traversing tree manner many iterations permit us compute average present value project also using simulation assign value project node thus node cash flow associated occur node reached value expectation value realized going forward values turn negative zero coupon risk free bonds purchased neutralize negative realization next find comparable apply expected rate return back project based variance returns iterate convergence finally subtract initial investment computed risk capital pv gross cash flows including debt determine project merits consideration comments clarifications money set aside avoid negative values clear mean values cash flow pv node anyhow shall setting aside money specific node nodes cross section time risk free asset pays states nature done every time negative realization thus typical project value risk capital may extremely high following tail based norm anymore memo appears suggest debt capacity contingent values positive issuing risk free debt also project single negative value cross section time positive debt capacity seems optimization argument discount rate obtained step comparison investment equating variances clear changing discount rate effect project variance lead global convergence also project finite life market based assets infinite lives light fact define relevant variance spot variance returns comparison investment finally criterion subtract average pv investment also risk capital setting risk capital zero model closely resembles intuitive present value criterion endogenously determines discount rate gas field case facilitate thinking providing gas field example invest x million dollars buy develop gas field profile expected production variance production per year available engineers beginning production autocorrelated profile shift based actual gas reserves less estimated reserves assume life field years salvage value fixed variable operating costs might useful think applying framework problem let know questions rakesh

"Subject: re : eprm article  chris ,  this is very well written and will serve the reader well . a few comments .  1 . when i think about the taxonomy of the var models , i typically use the  classification based on 3 categories :  a . variance / covariance method  b . historical simulation  c . monte carlo simulation .  delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear  instrument .  2 . i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation  of behavior of  all the market prices / rates , etc . , and revaluation of the entire portfolio .  the revaluation may be based on an approximation ( using taylor ' s expansion )  that may  involve delta , delta / gamma , delta / gamma / omega or may be exact ( based on the  same  model that produces the mark - to - market portfolio valuations ) .  the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the  ability to capture  the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way . i would  emphasize that  there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v / c model ( i shall send you  the references  from home ) .  3 . i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets  that are evolving  quickly ( new instruments for which we have no comparable prices ,  behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de - mature ) .  4 . for bigger portfolios , virtually all methods require some level of  aggregation into  atomic , elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem .  this process may be a source of a big error .  5 . the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing  of a portfolio that introduces no error . many swaps with the same underlying  can be aggregated into one positions ( they are portfolios of forwards and  they are linear  instruments ) .  please , feel free to use any comment ( or none ) .  vince  "" chris strickland "" on 08 / 28 / 2000 02 : 58 : 56 pm  please respond to "" chris strickland ""  to :  cc :  subject : eprm article  dear vince ,  ?  d you think you might be able to look at this in the next day or so ? robin  is after something by the end of this week .  ?  best regards .  ?  chris .  ?  - eprm _ 01 _ var . doc",0,subject eprm article chris well written serve reader well comments think taxonomy var models typically use classification based categories variance covariance method b historical simulation c monte carlo simulation delta approach way representing position nonlinear instrument would define monte carlo approach based statistical simulation behavior market prices rates etc revaluation entire portfolio revaluation may based approximation using taylor expansion may involve delta delta gamma delta gamma omega may exact based model produces mark market portfolio valuations main benefit using mc simulation energy markets ability capture gapping behavior energy markets straightforward way would emphasize attempts incorporate jumps v c model shall send references home would mention historical simulation may break markets evolving quickly new instruments comparable prices behavior prices may change markets mature de mature bigger portfolios virtually methods require level aggregation atomic elemental instruments reduce dimensionality problem process may source big error computational burden mc reduced clever preprocessing portfolio introduces error many swaps underlying aggregated one positions portfolios forwards linear instruments please feel free use comment none vince chris strickland pm please respond chris strickland cc subject eprm article dear vince think might able look next day robin something end week best regards chris eprm var doc

"" the government , way back in 1995 , has  modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of naphtha  from gujarat by electrical companies operating in maharashtra . the decision  was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphtha  at reduced rates within the state , "" government sources added . sources said  that these companies had to pay nearly 15 . 3 per cent sales tax on naphtha  that was procured from gujarat . however , following their representation , the  government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent .  the state finance department ' s opinion , which would be presented before the  state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision , deserves special  significance especially when the state energy department and the loss - making  maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) have wholeheartedly supported the  dpc ' s cause and recommended the sales tax waiver . dpc , which was asked by the  union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country in  view of excess availability , in its presentation to the state government and  to mseb , had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to  pass on the additional burden on the mseb which would be ultimately passed on  to its consumers . dpc had also told the state government that it had not paid  sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from glencore in the calender year  2000 .  sources from the state energy department and mseb have stressed on the need  for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burden .  they have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales tax  exemption to dpc because the ioc , at the behest of the centre , has tried to  match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed  memorandum of agreement with dpc . "" if the state finance department sticks to  its views , it may hurt the state as a whole , "" sources from the state energy  department and mseb said . dpc will procure naphtha at rs 11 , 050 per ton from  ioc during the calender year 2001 as compared to the rs 10 , 050 per tonne  price quoted by glencore . the naphtha price comprises $ 175 per tonne free on  board ( fob ) , 21 . 8 per cent of customs duty , 5 . 4 per cent of sales tax and  $ 18 . 87 of premium .  dpc senior vice president mukesh tyagi reiterated that the company has  already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on  naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers .

"" "" we are carefully watching the situation and will await a concrete  proposal before intervening in this matter , "" parbhu said on the sidelines of  greentech environment excellence awards ceremony , here . asked whether there  was any possibility of the government asking the power trading corporation to  buy power from the dhabol power corporation , prabhu replied "" what will the  ptc do with the power ? ""  prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before  approaching the centre for payment of dues . mseb had earlier declined to pick  up its 15 per cent stake in phase ii of the 1444 mw project . the enron issue  has been hanging fire with the maharashtra state electricity board unable to  clear the dues of dpc as a result of the skyrocketing prices of naphtha  infact mseb has asked dpc to backdown completely leading to a situation where  dpc has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the  month . state government has stepped in with support to the

"Subject: fw : london work  hi ,  how are you ? london seems to be the same as when i left in august - no sun , cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the excitement in enron credit .  it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper / duffie report seems to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate ( in his forwarded email ) that this is not the priority at the moment .  in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on the current state of enron credit - "" a fish rots from the head . ""  finally , i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this duffie report : do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear - that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting "" infrastructure "" ? or do you want to hear what i really see , hear , read , etc . ? if the latter is true , then i may need to write two reports , because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the enron credit personnel too happy .  well , i think i have said enough for now . look forward to your feedback .  thanks ,  iris  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : shanbhogue , vasant  sent : friday , may 04 , 2001 3 : 39 pm  to : mack , iris  cc : dhar , amitava  subject : london work  hi iris ,  amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work here . as a result , we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied . you should also make sure to understand the econometric / data analysis software side of the project - - this is probably more important than preparing a document for duffie right now . you should definitely sit with ben / george and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used . but we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data . both amitava and i will help as best as we can , and answer any direct questions , but we will have limited time to review documents , etc . i expect amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming , but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data .  hope the trip is going well . would you be extending the trip for some more time ?  vasant",0,subject fw london work hi london seems left august sun cold serious looking people expensive etc addition may day riots post office bombing train strike etc mention excitement enron credit would nice know supposed reporting getting loads conflicting messages illustrated forwarded email vasant according slava strategy paper duffie report seems higher priority however vasant seems indicate forwarded email priority moment addition seems lots chaos enron credit houston office even london office brings mind russian proverb learned slava expressed views current state enron credit fish rots head finally would like know exactly want write duffie report want hear enron credit would like hear need us develop private firm model exisiting infrastructure want hear really see hear read etc latter true may need write two reports learning look good would probably make enron credit personnel happy well think said enough look forward feedback thanks iris original message shanbhogue vasant sent friday may pm mack iris cc dhar amitava subject london work hi iris amitava must told getting swamped work result expect take lead scoping enron credit project making sure infrastructure readied also make sure understand econometric data analysis software side project probably important preparing document duffie right definitely sit ben george actually run software get feel used also need able try potential ways analyzing data amitava help best answer direct questions limited time review documents etc expect amitava get heavily involved data starts coming expect already set infrastructure etc data hope trip going well would extending trip time vasant
